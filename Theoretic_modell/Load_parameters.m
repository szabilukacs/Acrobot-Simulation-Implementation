% Initial state of the acrobot
% Q0 contains the initial angles and angular velocities of the links
% Format: [theta1, theta2, dtheta1, dtheta2]
% theta1: Initial angle of the first link (lower segment) in radians
% theta2: Initial angle of the second link (upper segment) in radians
% dtheta1: Initial angular velocity of the first link in rad/s
% dtheta2: Initial angular velocity of the second link in rad/s
Q0 = [pi 0 0 0];    % Starting with first link vertical (pi radians), all velocities zero
